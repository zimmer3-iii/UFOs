# UFOs

## Overview
	The purpose of this project was to create a website that dynamically filters a database of UFO sightings.
## Results
	The website can filter the sightings by any combination of the four user’s inputs to:
-	Date
-	City
-	State
-	Country

The website works by capturing the value of the user’s input after it is entered into one of the four filter fields. The website will display a new filtered list after every entry. When a second input is entered or if the first entry is changed, the website will update automatically with a new filtered list to display.

## Summary

The dynamic searching and displaying of the ufo sightings work pretty well if you know what you are looking for and how to enter the data
into the filter search.

### Recommendations for improvement:
- The search only uses the abbrevations for the states, create the ability to search by state names.
- The search is case sensitive, this could be frustrating for the user if unaware.
- The ability filter by Shape and Duration
- Have the filters have auto-complete suggestions when typing in filter entries.
