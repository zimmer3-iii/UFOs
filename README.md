# UFOs

## Overview
	The purpose of this project was to create a website that dynamically filters a database of UFO sightings.
## Results
	The website can filter the sightings by any combination of the four user’s inputs to:
-	Date
-	City
-	State
-	Country

The website works by capturing the value of the user’s input after it is entered into one of the four filter fields. The website will display a new filtered list after every entry. When a second input is entered or if the first entry is changed, the website will update automatically with a new filtered list to display.
